Sample code for the Google Go language (golang) presentation
============================================================

( Event homepage is at http://java.no/event/198 )


This git repository contains the set of sample programs that I wrote
for use during the presentation of the Google Go language at the
javaBin Stavanger member meetup on 2011.05.03.

Samples are inspired by code listed in the Getting Started, Tutorial and
Effective Go documents available from the Google Go homepage.

Google Go is of course available from at http://golang.org/
